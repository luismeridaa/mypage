      <blockquote>
      <p>One of my strongest skills is being a good listener. <sup>1</sup> I pay close attention to what people say, which helps me understand things better and 
        communicate more effectively. <sup>2</sup> Whether it’s in conversations, group work, or just everyday life, I make sure to listen before responding. 
        <sup>3</sup> This helps me connect with people, ask the right questions, and avoid misunderstandings. <sup>4</sup> I also have solid problem-solving skills, 
        which means I enjoy figuring things out and finding solutions. <sup>5</sup> When faced with a challenge, I like to break it down into smaller parts and look at
        different ways to solve it. <sup>6</sup> Instead of getting frustrated, I try to stay patient and keep an open mind. <sup>7</sup> One thing I’ve learned is that 
        there’s usually more than one way to approach a problem. <sup>8</sup> That’s why I like looking at things from different perspectivesit helps me understand 
        situations better and come up with creative solutions. <sup>9</sup> Sometimes, stepping back and seeing a problem from another angle makes all the difference. 
        <sup>10</sup> I also believe mistakes are just part of learning, so I don’t let them hold me back. <sup>11</sup> If something doesn’t work the first time, 
        I see it as a chance to improve. <sup>12</sup> Staying calm under pressure is another strength of mine, which helps me think clearly even when things get 
        stressful. <sup>13</sup> Whether I’m working alone or in a team, I always try to bring a problem-solving mindset to the table. <sup>14</sup> I enjoy learning 
        from others, and I believe that being open to different viewpoints makes me a better thinker. <sup>15</sup> No matter what I’m doing, I always look for ways 
        to grow and improve. <sup>16</sup> I try to take initiative in situations where I can help find a solution. <sup>17</sup> This proactive approach has allowed
         me to build stronger relationships with my peers and mentors. <sup>18</sup> I’ve also found that being adaptable in the face of challenges helps me stay 
         grounded and keep a positive outlook. <sup>19</sup> Ultimately, I believe that being a good listener and problem-solver is a continuous learning process, and
          I’m always eager to improve. <sup>20</sup></p>

      <p>Outside of school, I have a lot of hobbies that keep me busy and entertained. <sup>1</sup> One thing I really like is listening to music as it helps me relax and 
        sets the mood for whatever I’m doing. <sup>2</sup> Whether I’m studying, relaxing, or doing something else, the right music can completely change the mood.
        <sup>3</sup> I find that different types of music are good for different activities, so I’m always trying new playlists. <sup>4</sup> I also enjoy watching movies,
        especially romantic comedies, because they’re light and fun. <sup>5</sup> It’s a great way to relax and laugh, and they always have a happy ending. <sup>6</sup> 
        Romantic comedies never fail to make me feel good. <sup>7</sup> When I want to do something different, I spend a lot of time reading Korean webtoons. <sup>8</sup>
        They have cool stories and great art, and I’m always excited for the next chapter. <sup>9</sup> Webtoons have all kinds of stories, from action to drama, so I
        never get bored. <sup>10</sup> Another thing I like is playing basketball—it’s a good way to stay active and have some fun competition. <sup>11</sup> I love the
        excitement of the game and working with my teammates. <sup>12</sup> Basketball helps me get better at moving and staying in shape. <sup>13</sup> I also like
        playing video games, especially Valorant. <sup>14</sup> It’s all about quick reactions, planning, and working with others, and I love that challenge. 
        <sup>15</sup> Valorant always keeps me focused and sharp. <sup>16</sup> Then I like hanging out with my friends, whether we’re getting drinks, playing games
        together, or going out to new places. <sup>17</sup> Spending time with friends is the best way to relax and have fun, no matter what we’re doing. 
        <sup>18</sup> We spend hours just talking and laughing about random things. <sup>19</sup> Whether we’re joking around, checking out new places, or just
        having deep conversations, those moments are really important to me. <sup>20</sup> They remind me how much I care about my friends and the time 
        we spend together.</p>

      <p> I think technology is amazing because it’s always changing and getting better. <sup>1</sup> Every time you turn around, there’s some new gadget, app, or invention 
        that makes life easier or more fun. <sup>2</sup> It’s crazy how fast things are changing from AI and self driving cars to space travel and smart devices. 
        <sup>3</sup> I like keeping up with the latest tech because there’s always something new to learn. <sup>4</sup> Even though I don’t know how to code, I still 
        enjoy seeing how technology is shaping the world. <sup>5</sup> It’s cool to think about how things we use every day, like smartphones and social media, didn’t 
        exist not long ago. <sup>6</sup> The way AI is growing is especially amazing as it’s everywhere now, from voice assistants to sports stats. <sup>7</sup> Speaking 
        of sports, I really love watching them, especially basketball and baseball. <sup>8</sup> There’s nothing better than a close game, a last second shot, or an 
        unexpected comeback. <sup>9</sup> Basketball is super fast, and I love watching how players make quick decisions. <sup>10</sup> Baseball is all about planning, 
        and I enjoy seeing how teams decide their next move. <sup>11</sup> It’s also interesting how technology is changing sports, like with instant replays, player 
        tracking, and advanced stats. <sup>12</sup> Teams now use lots of data to play better, which makes the games even more fun to watch. <sup>13</sup> I think it’s 
        awesome how technology and sports are always improving as it keeps things interesting and never boring. <sup>14</sup> Whether it’s the latest tech gadgets or a 
        big game, I love staying updated and seeing what’s coming next. <sup>15</sup> It’s fascinating to see how fast tech and sports are evolving together. 
        <sup>16</sup> The way both worlds are mixing is making everything more exciting. <sup>17</sup> I enjoy reading about new inventions and breakthroughs that 
        change the way we live. <sup>18</sup> It feels like there’s always something new and cool to learn, which is why I keep following the news. <sup>19</sup> 
        Staying updated with tech and sports gives me something to look forward to every day. <sup>20</sup></p>
