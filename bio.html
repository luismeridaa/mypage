        <blockquote>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On April 5, 2006, I was born in Quezon City, and my family had a tremendous
influence on my early years. <sup>1</sup> From the moment I could walk and talk, my world was filled
with imagination, adventure, and excitement. <sup>2</sup> My parents encouraged me to explore and
learn, always supporting my curiosity. <sup>3</sup> Every day, I was constantly discovering something
new, whether it was through my parents' teachings, playing outside with friends, or
simply observing the world around me. <sup>4</sup> My sisters, being older and more experienced,
often guided me through childhood challenges and shaped my interests. <sup>5</sup> I have three
older sisters, and they played a huge role in influencing my hobbies, choices, and even
the way I saw the world. <sup>6</sup> Whether it was playing games, watching movies, or talking
about life, they were always there. <sup>7</sup> Going to school was another adventure in itself. I
enjoyed meeting new people, making friends, and learning about different subjects that
broadened my understanding of the world. <sup>8</sup> I was particularly drawn to creative activities,
technology, and anything that allowed me to express myself. <sup>9</sup> It was during this time that
I developed a passion for computers and technology, all thanks to my introduction to
gaming. <sup>10</sup> I remember the excitement I felt when I first played a video game, completely
immersed in a world beyond reality. <sup>11</sup> That moment sparked my love for technology, and
it has continued to grow ever since. <sup>12</sup> Despite being the youngest, I never felt left out. <sup>13</sup> My
family made sure I was loved, supported, and taken care of, which made me feel like the
main character in a movie. <sup>14</sup> There was never a dull moment in our home, as laughter,
love, and a sense of belonging filled every corner. <sup>15</sup> Looking back, I don’t remember every
single detail of my childhood, but I do remember the warmth and happiness that
surrounded me. <sup>16</sup> The memories of running around our neighborhood, playing with my
sisters, and celebrating birthdays remain vivid in my heart. <sup>17</sup> Even the small things—like
watching cartoons on Saturday mornings or eating my favorite homemade meals—hold
a special place in my mind. As I reflect on my early years, I realize how lucky and grateful
I am to have experienced such a wonderful childhood. <sup>18</sup>Those moments shaped the person
I am today, giving me a strong foundation of love, curiosity, and resilience. <sup>19</sup> My family’s
unwavering support gave me the confidence to explore new things and follow my
passions. <sup>20</sup> Without them, I wouldn’t have developed the interests and values that guide
me now. <sup>21</sup> Though childhood eventually faded into teenage years, the lessons and love I
received during that time will always stay with me. <sup>22</sup>

        <blockquote>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During my teenage years, life felt like a crammed rollercoaster of emotions,
experiences, and lessons. <sup>1</sup> Like many teenagers, the first two years of high school were
marked by the typical rebellious phase. There were moments when I fought with my
parents over rules, craved more freedom, and prioritized my friends’ opinions over family
guidance. <sup>2</sup> At the time, I didn’t realize how much my actions and attitude would eventually
haunt me.  <sup>3</sup> This continued until the end of 9th grade, when the COVID-19 pandemic
began—turning my whole world upside down. <sup>4</sup> The last memory I shared with my father
was him saying goodbye before leaving for a checkup. <sup>5</sup> At the time, I didn’t think much of
it; I figured he was just going in for a routine visit and would get better. <sup>6</sup> I was so caught
up in my own world that I didn’t even bother to hug him goodbye. <sup>8</sup> Instead, I stayed glued
to my screen, playing video games with my friends, unaware that this would be the last
time I would ever see him alive. <sup>9</sup> Weeks passed, and I believed he was recovering, but
one night, my mom woke me and my sisters up, sobbing while on the phone. <sup>10</sup> Through
her tears, she told us that Papa was gone and that we needed to go to the hospital. <sup>11</sup> In
that moment, my entire world shattered, and I felt a pain I had never known before. <sup>12</sup> The
guilt weighed heavily on me, and I found myself trapped in an endless cycle of regret. <sup>13</sup> I
started gaining a lot of weight, neglecting my health, and isolating myself from everyone
around me. <sup>14</sup> I felt like my world had completely ended, and I didn’t know how to move
forward. <sup>15</sup> My mind was filled with "what-ifs" and "what could have been," tormenting me
every single day. <sup>16</sup> I eventually fell into depression, struggling to find meaning in anything. <sup>17</sup>
Even now, I still dream about the moments I wish I could redo, the words I wish I had
said, and the time I wish I could have spent with my father. <sup>18</sup> The loss changed me in ways
I never expected, forcing me to see life from a different perspective. <sup>19</sup> Though the pain
never truly goes away, I have learned to carry it with me and use it as a reminder to
cherish the people I love while they are still here. <sup>20</sup>

        <blockquote>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;College was a turning point in my life. <sup>1</sup> It was the stage where I truly stepped into
independence, balancing academics, social life, and personal growth. <sup>2</sup> I’m currently
pursuing my studies in BSIT at the University of the East Manila. <sup>3</sup> Growing up in a techsavvy family, I always had a natural curiosity for computers and digital systems. <sup>4</sup> I would
say that I kind of always knew BSIT was the course I would take, but actually studying it
made me appreciate it even more. <sup>5</sup> The journey, however, hasn’t always been easy—long
nights of studying, tight deadlines, and the challenge of adapting to a new environment
constantly test my resilience. <sup>6</sup> Despite the challenges, college has also been a time of
incredible experiences. <sup>7</sup> I have met people who have inspired me, supported me, and
made this journey worthwhile. <sup>8</sup> I made lifelong friends who share the same struggles,
ambitions, and late-night study sessions. <sup>9</sup> Socially, college has helped me come out of my
shell and build more confidence. <sup>10</sup> I used to be shy when meeting new people, but being
in college has pushed me to socialize, connect, and create valuable relationships. <sup>11</sup> There
were times when I doubted myself, questioning if I had chosen the right path, but every
small achievement reminded me why I was here. <sup>12</sup> One of my proudest moments in college
was the first time I got a high mark on an exam. <sup>13</sup> That moment made me realize that this
was the path I wanted to take because, for the first time, I actually enjoyed reviewing. <sup>14</sup>
Learning became something I looked forward to rather than something I just had to do. <sup>15</sup>
I still have two years before I graduate, and I am so excited for what’s to come. <sup>16</sup> The idea
of stepping into the real world, applying what I’ve learned, and building a career in IT
motivates me every single day. <sup>17</sup> While the future is uncertain, I know that as long as I
stay determined, I will achieve my goals. <sup>18</sup> College has been a journey of self-discovery,
challenges, and triumphs, and I wouldn’t trade this experience for anything. <sup>19</sup>
