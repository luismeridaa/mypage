    <h2>TV Shows</h2>       
    
    
    <h3>The Mentalist</h3>
    <p>The series follows Patrick Jane, an independent consultant for the California Bureau of Investigation (CBI) based in Sacramento, California. Although not an officer of the law, he uses his skills from his former career as a successful, yet admittedly fraudulent, psychic medium to help a team of CBI agents solve murders. The real reason for Jane's involvement with law enforcement is to track down the serial killer, known as Red John, who was responsible for the brutal murders of his wife, Angela Ruskin Jane, and his daughter, Charlotte Anne Jane.</p>

    <h3>Grey's Anatomy</h3>
    <p>The series follows the life of Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), the daughter of world renowned general surgeon Ellis Grey (Kate Burton), starting from her acceptance into the surgical residency program at the fictional Seattle Grace Hospital (later named Seattle Grace Mercy West, and finally, Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital).</p>

    <h2>Movies</h2>
    
    
    <h3>Man In Love</h3>
    <p>“Man in Love” is an entertaining movie, benefitting the most by its cast and protagonist values. The way the quality decreases in the second part, probably in an effort to follow the omnipresent melodramatic tendencies of Korean cinema found in the original, costs the movie significantly. Still it deserves a watch, but can also be perceived as a missed opportunity for something much better.</p>
